html-layout
===========

Fork this repo then clone your fork onto your local machines. Inside each folder you'll find an image. That image contains the layout you need to build with HTML and CSS. The 'first' folder contains an index.html and a style.css file. In the other folders you'll need to add them yourself. *Your first step should be connecting your CSS sheet with your HTML sheet.
